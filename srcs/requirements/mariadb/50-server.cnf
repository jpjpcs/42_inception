# Introductory comments explaining the configuration groups
#
# These groups are read by MariaDB server.
# Use it for options that only the server (but not clients) should see

# Define a configuration group for the MariaDB server
# this is read by the standalone daemon and embedded servers
[server]

# Specify an SQL file to execute on server startup
init_file = /etc/mysql/init.sql

# Define a configuration group for the mysqld standalone daemon
# this is only for the mysqld standalone daemon
[mysqld]

#
# * Basic Settings
#

#user                    = mysql
user			 = root
pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
basedir                 = /usr
datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
tmpdir                  = /tmp

# Set the MariaDB server to run as the root user
#user			 = root
# Set the location of the PID file
#pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
# Set the base directory for MariaDB binaries
#basedir                 = /usr
# Set the directory for database storage
#datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
# Set the directory for temporary files
#tmpdir                  = /tmp

# Commented-out option to skip DNS resolution for faster connections
# Broken reverse DNS slows down connections considerably and name resolve is
# safe to skip if there are no "host by domain name" access grants
#skip-name-resolve

# Configure MariaDB to listen on the mariadb hostname (Docker network alias)
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address            = mariadb

#
# * Fine Tuning
#

#key_buffer_size        = 128M
#max_allowed_packet     = 1G
#thread_stack           = 192K
#thread_cache_size      = 8
# This replaces the startup script and checks MyISAM tables if needed
# the first time they are touched
#myisam_recover_options = BACKUP
#max_connections        = 100
#table_cache            = 64

#
# * Logging and Replication
#

# Note: The configured log file or its directory need to be created
# and be writable by the mysql user, e.g.:
# $ sudo mkdir -m 2750 /var/log/mysql
# $ sudo chown mysql /var/log/mysql

# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# Recommend only changing this at runtime for short testing periods if needed!
#general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
#general_log            = 1

# When running under systemd, error logging goes via stdout/stderr to journald
# and when running legacy init error logging goes to syslog due to
# /etc/mysql/conf.d/mariadb.conf.d/50-mysqld_safe.cnf
# Enable this if you want to have error logging into a separate file
#log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
# Enable the slow query log to see queries with especially long duration
#log_slow_query_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log
#log_slow_query_time    = 10
#log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan,explain
#log-queries-not-using-indexes
#log_slow_min_examined_row_limit = 1000

# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.
#server-id              = 1
#log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log

# Set the expiration period for binary logs
expire_logs_days        = 10
#max_binlog_size        = 100M

#
# * SSL/TLS
#

# For documentation, please read
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/securing-connections-for-client-and-server/
#ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/cacert.pem
#ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/server-cert.pem
#ssl-key = /etc/mysql/server-key.pem
#require-secure-transport = on

# Set the default character set to utf8mb4 for full Unicode support
#
# * Character sets
#

# MySQL/MariaDB default is Latin1, but in Debian we rather default to the full
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
character-set-server  = utf8mb4
collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
#character-set-server  = utf8mb4
# Set the default collation to utf8mb4_general_ci (case-insensitive)
#collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci

#
# * InnoDB
#

# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# Most important is to give InnoDB 80 % of the system RAM for buffer use:
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size
#innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G

# Define a configuration group for the embedded server
# this is only for embedded server
[embedded]

# Define a group for MariaDB-specific options
# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here
[mariadb]

# Define a group for MariaDB-10.11-specific options
# This group is only read by MariaDB-10.11 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand
[mariadb-10.11]
